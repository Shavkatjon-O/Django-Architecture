## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Design**: Clearly separates application modules into `apps`, `services`, and `utils`.
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Supports `base`, `develop`, and `production` settings for flexible deployment.
- **Dockerized Development**: Includes Docker and Docker Compose for containerized development and production environments.
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Ensures code quality with pre-configured pre-commit checks.
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for large and scalable Django projects.
- **Gunicorn Integration**: Optimized production server configuration with Gunicorn.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shavkatjon-O/Django-Architecture.git
   cd Django-Architecture
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/develop.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Dockerized Setup

1. **Build and start the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-develop.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application:**

   Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🧩 Modules

### **Core**
Contains project-wide settings, configurations, and URLs. The `settings` directory allows for environment-specific configurations (`base.py`, `develop.py`, `production.py`).

### **Apps**
Each app encapsulates a specific functionality or feature of the project. Example apps:
- `common`: Shared utilities and base models.
- `users`: User management, authentication, and profile handling.

### **Services**
A service layer for business logic, keeping your models and views clean and focused.

### **Utils**
Shared utilities, reusable helpers, and custom scripts.

---

## 📦 Deployment

1. **Production Build:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up --build
   ```

2. **Gunicorn Server:**
   The `gunicorn_conf.py` provides optimized configurations for production.

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests with:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Ensure proper code quality with pre-commit:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
